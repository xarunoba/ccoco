**`ccoco`** â€” change config on checkout

Change your configurations on checkout for easy environment change. Integrate with git hooks.

## Why

My team didn't want to populate the `package.json` too much with scripts so I created a tool that can easily replace the main config files whenever a branch changed.
`ccoco` initially started as a tool specifically used for the Node.js ecosystem but has been rewritten to Go for platform independence. You can use `ccoco` for any kinds of projects as long as it is within a Git repository.
