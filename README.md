**`ccoco`** â€” change config on checkout

Change your configurations on checkout for easy environment change. Integrate with git hooks.

## Why

My team didn't want to populate the `package.json` too much with scripts so I created a tool that can easily replace the main config file after every checkout. `ccoco` fixes this issue by checking for lockfile updates and running install.

## Installation

### npm

```bash
npm install -D @xarunoba/ccoco
# run locally
npx ccoco
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm install -D @xarunoba/ccoco
# run locally
pnpm ccoco
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add --dev @xarunoba/ccoco
# run locally
yarn run ccoco
```

## Usage

### npm

```bash
npx @xarunoba/ccoco
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm dlx @xarunoba/ccoco
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn dlx @xarunoba/ccoco
```

### flags

You can add the following flags for `ccoco`:

- `-v, --version` â€” Show version number
- `-h, --help` â€” Show help
- `-c, --cleaninstall` â€” use `ci` (npm) or `--frozen-lockfile` (pnpm, yarn) when installing
- `-s, --strict` â€” Will immediately exit if any issues are found
- `-q, --quiet` â€” Will not log anything to the console

## Integrations

### With [`simple-git-hooks`](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks)

Integrating with [`simple-git-hooks`](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks) is easy as a toasted bread:

```json
// package.json
{
  ...
  "simple-git-hooks": {
    // I prefer always using the latest version of ccoco
    // instead of installing it as a dev dependency.
    // If you have installed it locally, you can use:
    // "post-checkout": "npx ccoco"
    "post-checkout": "npx @xarunoba/ccoco"
  }
  ...
}
```
