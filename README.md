**`ccoco`** â€” change config on checkout

Change your configurations on checkout for easy environment change. Integrate with git hooks.

## Why

My team didn't want to populate the `package.json` too much with scripts so I created a tool that can easily replace the main config files after every checkout. `ccoco` fixes this issue by automatically changing your main config files per branch name.
